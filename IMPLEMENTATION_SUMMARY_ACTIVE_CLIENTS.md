# Implementation Summary: Active Clients Sync

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds support for syncing **active clients** (sold contacts) from GoHighLevel to CallTools, automatically moving them from the "Cold Leads" bucket to the "ACA Active clients" bucket.

## Changes Made

### 1. CallTools Client (`src/clients/calltools.ts`)

Added two new methods for tag management:

- **`addTagToContact(contactId, tagName)`**: Adds a tag to a contact in CallTools
- **`removeTagFromContact(contactId, tagName)`**: Removes a tag from a contact in CallTools

### 2. Contact Sync Service (`src/services/contactSyncService.ts`)

#### Modified `syncSingleContact()` Method

Updated the webhook handler to detect active client tags before processing as cold leads:

```typescript
// Priority order:
1. Check for "ACA Active 2025" or "ACA Active 2026" → syncActiveClient()
2. Check for generic customer tags → markAsCustomer()
3. Check for cold lead tags → sync as cold lead
4. Otherwise → exclude
```

#### Added `syncActiveClient()` Method

New private method that handles the complete active client workflow:

**Configuration:**
- Active Clients Bucket ID: `11252`
- Cold Leads Bucket ID: `11237`
- Active Client Tag: `"ACA Active client"`
- Cold Lead Tag: `"ACA Cold lead"`

**Process:**
1. ✅ Fetch contact from GoHighLevel
2. ✅ Validate contact has phone number
3. ✅ Create or update contact in CallTools
4. ✅ Add to "ACA Active clients" bucket (11252)
5. ✅ Remove from "Cold Leads" bucket (11237) if present
6. ✅ Add "ACA Active client" tag
7. ✅ Remove "ACA Cold lead" tag if present
8. ✅ Update sync record in database
9. ✅ Mark as customer (is_customer = 1)

## How It Works

### GoHighLevel Setup

1. **Tag Contact**: When a sale is made, add tag:
   - `ACA Active 2025` OR
   - `ACA Active 2026`

2. **Workflow Fires**: GoHighLevel workflow sends webhook with contact ID

3. **Automatic Processing**: Contact is synced to CallTools with proper bucket and tags

### What Happens in CallTools

**For New Active Clients:**
- Created in CallTools database
- Added to "ACA Active clients" bucket (11252)
- Tagged with "ACA Active client"

**For Existing Contacts (Previously Cold Leads):**
- Contact info updated
- Moved from "Cold Leads" bucket (11237) to "ACA Active clients" bucket (11252)
- "ACA Cold lead" tag removed
- "ACA Active client" tag added

## Testing

All existing tests pass:
```
✓ tests/integration/tasks.test.ts (11 tests)
✓ tests/integration/dummyEndpoint.test.ts (1 test)

Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests  12 passed (12)
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- **Missing phone number**: Contact skipped with error message
- **Tag doesn't exist**: Removal skipped (no error)
- **Not in Cold Leads bucket**: Error logged, process continues
- **Network errors**: Full error details logged and returned

## API Response

### Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Contact updated successfully in CallTools",
  "data": {
    "contact_id": "abc123",
    "action": "updated",
    "bucket_id": "11252"
  }
}
```

### Failure
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to sync contact: No phone number",
  "data": {
    "contact_id": "abc123",
    "action": "failed",
    "bucket_id": null
  }
}
```

## Logging

Detailed console logs for monitoring:

```
Processing active client: abc123
Updating existing contact abc123 as active client
Added contact to Active Clients bucket (11252)
Removed contact from Cold Leads bucket (11237)
Added "ACA Active client" tag
Removed "ACA Cold lead" tag
Successfully updated contact abc123 as active client
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/clients/calltools.ts`**
   - Added `addTagToContact()` method
   - Added `removeTagFromContact()` method

2. **`src/services/contactSyncService.ts`**
   - Modified `syncSingleContact()` to detect active client tags
   - Added `syncActiveClient()` method with complete workflow

3. **`ACTIVE_CLIENTS_FEATURE.md`** (new)
   - Complete documentation for the feature
   - Setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

4. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_ACTIVE_CLIENTS.md`** (this file)
   - Summary of changes made

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Configure GoHighLevel Workflow**
   - Set trigger: Tag Added = "ACA Active 2025" OR "ACA Active 2026"
   - Add HTTP POST action to webhook endpoint
   - Include `{"contact_id": "{{contact.id}}"}` in body

3. **Test with Real Contact**
   - Tag a test contact with "ACA Active 2025"
   - Verify appears in CallTools "ACA Active clients" bucket
   - Verify has "ACA Active client" tag
   - Verify removed from "Cold Leads" bucket

4. **Monitor Logs**
   - Check CloudFlare Workers logs for successful syncs
   - Watch for any errors or issues

## Technical Notes

- **Case-insensitive tag matching**: Tags are converted to lowercase for comparison
- **Graceful degradation**: If bucket removal fails, sync continues
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe to run multiple times on same contact
- **Database consistency**: All operations update sync tracking database
- **Customer marking**: Active clients marked as `is_customer = 1` in database
